## Welcome to Code Corvallis

### Interested in coding and software development?

<!--@include: ../includes/join_us.md-->

Corvallis has a unique, underground tech community, and Code Corvallis offers a window into this vibrant scene. We’re here to create connections, foster collaboration, and provide a space where developers can come together and grow. We aim to keep things simple, focused, and tailored to the needs of our coding community.

Let’s come together to share knowledge and dive into the world of software development! Follow us on our website to stay updated on upcoming events and join us at our next meetup.

### ✅ What to Expect at Code Corvallis Meetups

* 🕕 **We meet every other Thursday, 6–8pm (currently at Natural Grocers in the kitchen demo room).**
* 💬 Casual, drop-in format — no RSVP needed.
* 🧑‍💻 Discussions about code, software, projects, and career stuff.
* 🗣️ Bring ideas, questions, projects, or job leads — all are welcome.
* 🎤 Occasionally, someone gives a short talk or shares a demo.
* 🙌 Open to all experience levels and tech backgrounds.

We generally send out a reminder about each meetup the day-of in [Discord](/community). If a meeting is ever canceled or rescheduled, it will typically be updated and posted clearly on the website and also announced in [Discord](/community).
